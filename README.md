##### Draw With Friends (v1.0) - By Steven Furnari

## **Project**
The final project for my 12 week Software Engineering bootcamp with General Assembly. I chose to build this app because of the need to use the HTML5 Canvas element and Socket.io as this was something that wasn't covered in the course and found to be an exciting challenge.

## **Tech Stack**
- React
- Node
- Express
- Socket.io

## **Description**
Draw with friends is a browser based multiplayer pictionary-like game where a user is given a random word to draw and the other users try to guess the correct word. 
On a correct guess, that user will gain points and become the next drawer.

## **Wishlist**
- More mobile friendly
- Implement score conditions
- Ability to create seperate game rooms
- UI fixes
- Add game sounds
